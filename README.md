# fs-enc
CLI tool to encrypt and decrypt files with passphrase

## Why?

One of my use cases is to encrypt files stored in the **home** directory that may contain sensitive information.

I don't need to encrypt the whole file system, just a couple of files.

## Usage

## Encrypt
```bash
fs-enc enc <filepath> <passphrase>
```

## Decrypt
```bash
fs-enc dec <filepath> <passphrase>
```
